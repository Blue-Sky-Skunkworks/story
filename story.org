** Orson Welles, "The Third Man"
In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare,
terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michaelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.  In Switzerland, they had
brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace --
and what did they produce?  The cuckoo-clock.
** Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
   Mind

   The Way bears sensation,
   Sensation bears memory,
   Sensation and memory bear abstraction,
   And abstraction bears all the world;
   Each thing in the world bears feeling and doing,
   And, imbued with mind, harmony with the Way.
   As others have taught, so do I teach,
   "Who loses harmony opposes nature";
   This is the root of my teaching.

   Rulers

   The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;
   The next best are loved and praised;
   The next are feared;
   The next despised:
   They have no faith in their people,
   And their people become unfaithful to them.
   When the best rulers achieve their purpose
   Their subjects claim the achievement as their own.
